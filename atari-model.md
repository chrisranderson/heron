## Queries for the model


#####
Creating a formal metaphysical model. Does the agent learn the answers to these questions? Seems like it is trying to determine these things.

## Questions that I have to answer:
- Are objects wholes, or parts that lack any relationship to eachother?
- Why do objects act? Is it a sum of its parts? Does it have parts?
- Are actions and reactions deterministic?
    + It may be, but we can probably model it using determinism.
- What constitutes the identity of an object? What if it changes shape?
- Cause and effect/relationships, properties, being, relations
- Modal/multiple possible worlds reasoning helpful? Seems like it might, since there are actually multiple worlds.
- When does existence of a thing begin and end? When does it change?
- Are there categories of things?
- How much?
- Where is it?
- What constitutes an object?
- What do objects have in common?
- Are there universal governing facts?
    + This is more about figuring out what the governing facts are, at least in Atari.
- Abstract vs. concrete properties
- What constitutes a cause and an effect? An agent and an object?
- How certain can we be about any of this?
- Can a cause succeed its effect

What is the agent's place in the world?
How does it fit into the world?
What type of world is it?

# discussion with professor
- Are there metaphysical systems of thinking that I can formalize in code instead of making it up again?
- There are a bunch of questions in metaphysics that I have to answer. What questions am I missing?
- Are there systems that are proven that I don't have to assume?

## to study
- category theory
